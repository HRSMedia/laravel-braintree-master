(A) There is a proven history of late payments or the Customer has not demonstrated established credit. &nbsp;A proven history of late payments is defined as 2 or more occasions within the preceding 12 months in which payment(s) for the undisputed charges of that month&rsquo;s total billings (sum of all bills sent in that month for all accounts for all services provided under this Agreement by Voyyp) was not received by the payment due date. &nbsp;In the event that a Customer has a history of late payments or has not demonstrated established credit, Voyyp may require the Customer to pay a two-month deposit based on the total charges billed and rendered by Voyyp for the most recent two months of service. In the event the Customer has not received two months of service from Voyyp, the two-month deposit will be based on charges estimated by Voyyp for the initial two-month period. Voyyp will provide the Customer written notice by email, if a deposit is required under this section. The Customer must pay the two-month deposit within 15 business days following the date the written notice is sent to the Customer. Such notice period will begin the day after the notice is sent. If the Customer fails to pay the deposit by the due date, as described above, Voyyp may send the Customer a written notice by email stating that if the deposit is not received within 15 calendar days of the original deposit due date, Voyyp may take any or all of the actions allowed by the Agreement and/or applicable law. &nbsp;Simple interest at a rate set forth following will accrue on cash deposits. &nbsp;Simple interest will be applied for the number of days from the date the Customer deposit is received by Voyyp to and including the date such deposit is credited to the Customer&#39;s account or the date the deposit is refunded by Voyyp. The cash deposit will be returned, with any accrued, uncredited interest within 15 business days of when a Customer with a history of late payments or no established credit history demonstrates a one-year prompt payment record. &nbsp;In the event the provision of all service to the Customer is terminated and Voyyp maintains a cash deposit from the Customer, the deposit and any accrued, uncredited interest will be applied to any outstanding sums owed to Voyyp, and any remaining balance will be returned to the Customer.</span></li><li class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></li></ul><p class="c5"><span class="c3">The fact that a security deposit has been made in no way relieves Customer from prompt payment of bills upon presentation. &nbsp;Voyyp may require or receive advance payment from Customer for purposes including, but not limited to security deposit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><ul class="c11 lst-kix_nbzyysmzrf9y-0 start"><li class="c2"><span class="c0">FEDERAL UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND (FUSF) SURCHARGE</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;The Federal Universal Service Fund (FUSF) Surcharge recovers Voyyp&rsquo;s contributions to the Universal Service Support Mechanisms.

The Customer must annually certify exemption from FUSF Surcharges. &nbsp;A percentage surcharge factor is assessed monthly on billed recurring and non-recurring charges of end user services other than surcharges described herein.</span></li><li class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">OTHER SURCHARGES</span><span class="c3">. &nbsp;With respect to any purchase of Service, if any Federal, state or local government tax, fee, surcharge, or other tax-like charge, including any state USF fee (a &quot;Tax&quot;) is required or permitted by applicable law, ordinance, regulation or tariff to be collected from Customer by Voyyp, then (i) Voyyp will bill Customer for such Tax, (ii) Customer will timely remit such Tax to Voyyp, and (iii) Voyyp will remit such collected Tax to the applicable taxing or fee-imposing authority.</span></li><li class="c2 c8"><span class="c3"></span></li><li class="c2"><span class="c0">SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR PREPAID, FLAT-RATE CUSTOMERS &nbsp;</span><span class="c3">In the event Customer and Voyyp agree, Customer will pay for Services on a prepaid or flat-rate basis (i.e., Customer receives a fixed number of calls or minutes of use, per billing period) and experiences &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; of any type or fraudulent calls of any nature, Customer shall be liable for any additional number of calls or minutes of use associated with such &ldquo;hacking&rdquo; of any type or fraudulent calls of any nature irrespective of any agreement between Customer and Voyyp for the provision of Services on a prepaid, flat-rate basis. &nbsp;Customer&rsquo;s total liability shall be the agreed-to, prepaid, flat-rate charge, plus Voyyp&rsquo;s, and then currently effective rates and charges applicable to the additional number of calls or minutes of use without regard as to how such additional calls or minutes of use were generated.</span></li></ul><hr><p class="c4 c8"><span class="c13"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c12">DIALER SERVICES AGREEMENT</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This dialer services agreement (&ldquo;Agreement&rdquo;) is made by and between (1) Voyyp, LLC.

Voyyp cannot be responsible if you add other software or hardware that corrupt the system or for any other malfunctions. Voyyp also strives to keep its VoIP Services to its customers operational 100% of the time as Voyyp&rsquo;s VoIP Services has multiple safeguards; however, various factors can cause outages, interruptions, and degradation of VoIP Services from time to time. Those factors (many are beyond Voyyp&rsquo;s control) can include, but are not limited to, acts of nature, equipment failure, power outages, carrier problems, human error, cybercrime, and internet failure or disruption. (Note: Landlines and cellular lines are also subject to acts of nature, human error, equipment failures, and power failures.) Voyyp does not warrant that its VoIP Services will always function without failure, delay, interruption, error, or degradation of voice quality or loss of content, data, or information. You agree to accept the service &ldquo;as is&rdquo;. You agree that you will always use truthful caller ID information when conducting your calling campaigns. Voyyp will act in good faith to accommodate your Caller ID preferences, but you realize that regarding porting and other Caller ID processes, Voyyp has little control and is normally subject to the procedures and timelines established by telephone carriers and telco providers. Therefore, Voyyp assumes no obligation to complete any porting or similar Caller ID transfer process within any specific period of time. Voyyp has provided you with tools to assist in cleaning your dialing lists of DNC telephone numbers; however, Voyyp cannot guarantee 100% integrity or reliability of these tools. Voyyp stores your call detail records for a minimum of 30 days. If you are using Voyyp&#39;s optional cloud call recording, Voyyp will store your calls based on mutually agreed terms between you and Voyyp. To keep call detail records and recordings longer, you will need to import these onto your own devices. Regardless of the causes or damages or lost income or additional expenses incurred by any loss, interruption, or degradation of service, you are not entitled to any refund or credit in the event of loss, interruption, or degradation of service. Your sole remedy is cancellation of future service. In the event a court awards direct damages, despite the foregoing, such damages shall in no case exceed the amount of the last payment for the services. In addition, Voyyp cannot be relied upon for calling 911 or other life-line services in an emergency. Operators will not automatically know your physical location to render assistance. Voyyp will in no way accept responsibility for failure of the service to contact help in cases of emergency. Voyyp may NOT be used for operator (or directory) assistance. Voyyp may revoke your license and all access to the products and related support at any time for no reason or any reason, including without limitation, if Voyyp has any reason to believe, at its sole discretion that: (1) you may have violated the law or this Agreement; (2) you may have otherwise acted unethically or immorally when using the products; or (3) the law has changed and no longer allows your continued use of the products.
